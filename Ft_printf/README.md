<h1>ft_printf</h1>

ft_printf is a project that aims to recreate the behavior of the standard C library function printf, but with some added functionality and improved performance. The project includes a custom implementation of the printf function as well as several helper functions.

<h1>Functionality</h1>

The ft_printf function supports a wide range of format specifiers, including:

%d, %i: signed decimal integer
%u: unsigned decimal integer
%o: unsigned octal
%x, %X: unsigned hexadecimal
%f: floating point number
%e, %E: scientific notation with exponent
%g, %G: short format for floating point numbers
%c: character
%s: string
%p: pointer address
%%: print a percent symbol
%n: write the number of characters written so far to a variable
